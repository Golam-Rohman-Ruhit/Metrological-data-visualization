The primary objective of this section is to utilize Python's scientific ecosystem to process and visualize
ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis data. 
The implementation begins with the extraction of variables such as 2-meter temperature (t2m), surface
pressure (sp), and wind components (u10, v10) from the 2023.nc file.
